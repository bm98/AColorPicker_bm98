his list of credits and contributions is repeated here:

* Bob Powell  
    I based my AdobeColors class on one I found on his GDI+ website. I also found other parts of his website very handy when it came to drawing the gradients for the user controls. His website can be found here.

* Anna-Carin  
    I found a Adobe Color Picker clone written in VB6 in an article found here. While I decided to take a completely different approach with my project, I did find the RGB to HSL methods very handy, and were more accurate to Adobe’s methods.

* Mick Tilbury  
    Yet anther website I stumbled across in my web surfing, it had a very simple but elegant solution to convert from RGB to CMYK that I found useful. That website can be found here.

* Adobe  
    Without Adobe Photoshop, I couldn’t really make an Adobe Photoshop Color Picker Clone.
